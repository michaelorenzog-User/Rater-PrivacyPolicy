<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 9, 2026</p>

<p>Rater ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Rater mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the App. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<p>This app is intended for users aged 13 and older. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users and we comply with applicable laws including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>

<p><strong>Device Identifiers</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous user IDs and device identifiers generated by third-party services such as RevenueCat for subscription management</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User-Provided Content</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Photos captured or selected by users for facial analysis. These photos are processed entirely on your device using on-device machine learning (Google ML Kit) and are never uploaded to or stored on our servers.</li>
  <li>Optional demographic information (e.g., gender), provided at the user's discretion during onboarding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>App interactions and usage data (e.g., features accessed, session duration)</li>
  <li>Crash logs and diagnostic data</li>
  <li>Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Purchase Information</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase and subscription history, processed through RevenueCat and Google Play Billing. RevenueCat is a third-party service used to manage subscriptions and may collect purchase-related identifiers and transaction data.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not require or collect your real name, phone number, email address, or physical address to use the App. No user account is required.</p>

<h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>

<p>Facial analysis in Rater is performed entirely on your device using on-device machine learning technology (Google ML Kit). Your photos are not sent to, uploaded to, or stored on any external server. All analysis results and user data are stored locally on your device and are not accessible to us.</p>

<p>Because all data is stored locally on the device, uninstalling the App will permanently delete all locally stored data, including scan history and analysis results.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To provide core features such as on-device facial analysis feedback and scores</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> To manage your subscriptions through RevenueCat and Google Play Billing</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Monitoring:</strong> To understand how users interact with the App, improve performance, and fix bugs</li>
  <li><strong>Fraud Prevention, Security, and Compliance:</strong> To protect against unauthorized access, detect abuse, and comply with legal obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>

<p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

<p>We may share information with the following categories of service providers, solely to support the operation of the App:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> A third-party service used for subscription and purchase management. RevenueCat may collect anonymous device identifiers and transaction data to process subscriptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> For app usage analytics and performance monitoring</li>
  <li><strong>Crash Reporting Tools:</strong> For diagnosing and resolving technical issues</li>
</ul>

<p>These service providers are contractually obligated to use your information only for the purposes of providing their services to us and in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>

<p>We may also disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of our users or the public.</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>This app is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a user under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@raterapp.com">support@raterapp.com</a> so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<p>For users between the ages of 13 and 17, we encourage parental awareness and oversight of App usage.</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

<p>User-generated content such as photos, scan results, and analysis data is stored locally on your device and is not retained by us on any server. This data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the App.</p>

<p>Subscription and purchase records managed by RevenueCat and Google Play are retained in accordance with those services' respective privacy policies and applicable legal requirements.</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. Where data is transmitted to third-party services (such as RevenueCat for subscription management), it is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).</p>

<p>Because facial analysis data and photos remain on your device and are never transmitted to our servers, the security of that data is governed by the security of your device itself.</p>

<p>While we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>

<p><strong>All Users</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you</li>
  <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
  <li>Request deletion of your personal data</li>
  <li>Delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the App</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>European Economic Area (EEA) Residents — GDPR Rights</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data</li>
  <li>Right to restrict or object to processing</li>
  <li>Right to data portability</li>
  <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time, where processing is based on consent</li>
  <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>California Residents — CCPA Rights</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right to know what personal information is collected, used, and shared</li>
  <li>Right to request deletion of personal information</li>
  <li>Right to opt out of the sale of personal information (note: we do not sell personal data)</li>
  <li>Right to non-discrimination for exercising your privacy rights</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@raterapp.com">support@raterapp.com</a>. We will respond to your request within the timeframes required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Certain information processed by third-party services (such as RevenueCat for subscription management) may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of such information to countries that may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction. We take appropriate safeguards to ensure your data remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Facial analysis data and photos remain on your device and are not transferred internationally.</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

<p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access through the App.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
