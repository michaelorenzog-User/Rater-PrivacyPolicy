<h1>Rater &mdash; Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 9, 2026</p>

<div class="summary-box">
  <p><strong>At a Glance</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos are analyzed <strong>entirely on your device</strong> and are <strong>never uploaded</strong> to our servers.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your real name, phone number, email address, or physical address.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the App permanently deletes all locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Rater (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) operates the Rater mobile application (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect, how we use and protect that information, the circumstances under which we may share it, and the choices available to you.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the App, regardless of location. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described herein, please do not use the App.</p>

<p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older. We comply with all applicable data-protection laws, including but not limited to the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act / California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA/CPRA)</strong>, the <strong>Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong>, and Google Play&rsquo;s Developer Program Policies.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 1 ===== -->
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate the App and provide its features. The categories of data we collect are set out below.</p>

<h3>1.1 Device Identifiers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous user IDs and device identifiers generated automatically by third-party services (such as RevenueCat) for the sole purpose of subscription and purchase management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 User-Provided Content</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Photos.</strong> Photos captured or selected by users for facial analysis are processed entirely on your device using on-device machine learning (Google ML Kit). Photos are <strong>never uploaded to, transmitted to, or stored on</strong> any external server controlled by us or any third party.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional demographic information</strong> (e.g., gender), which may be provided voluntarily during onboarding. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted externally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>App interaction and usage data (e.g., features accessed, screens viewed, session duration)</li>
  <li>Crash logs and diagnostic data</li>
  <li>Device information (e.g., device model, operating-system version, language settings)</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4 Purchase Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subscription and purchase history, processed through <strong>RevenueCat</strong> and <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. RevenueCat may collect purchase-related identifiers and transaction data necessary to manage subscriptions. We do not directly process or store payment-card details; all payment processing is handled by Google Play.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information we do not collect.</strong> We do not require or collect your real name, email address, phone number, physical address, or precise geolocation. No user account or sign-in is required to use the App.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 2 ===== -->
<h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>

<p>All facial analysis in Rater is performed <strong>entirely on your device</strong> using Google ML Kit, an on-device machine-learning framework. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your photos are <strong>never</strong> sent to, uploaded to, or stored on any external server.</li>
  <li>All analysis results, scan history, and related user data are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> and are not accessible to us.</li>
  <li>Because all content is stored locally, <strong>uninstalling the App will permanently and irreversibly delete</strong> all locally stored data, including photos, scan history, and analysis results.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===== SECTION 3 ===== -->
<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the limited information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To deliver the App&rsquo;s core features, including on-device facial analysis, feedback, and scoring.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> To facilitate and manage subscriptions and in-app purchases through RevenueCat and Google Play Billing.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Monitoring:</strong> To understand aggregate usage patterns, improve app performance, identify bugs, and enhance the user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Fraud Prevention, Security, and Compliance:</strong> To detect and prevent abuse, unauthorized access, or fraudulent activity, and to comply with applicable legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for behavioral advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to the operation and improvement of the App.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 4 ===== -->
<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2>

<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data under the following legal bases as defined by the GDPR:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contractual Necessity (Art.&nbsp;6(1)(b)):</strong> Processing necessary to provide the App&rsquo;s services to you, including subscription management.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art.&nbsp;6(1)(f)):</strong> Processing for analytics, performance monitoring, fraud prevention, and security, where such interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Obligation (Art.&nbsp;6(1)(c)):</strong> Processing required to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent (Art.&nbsp;6(1)(a)):</strong> Where you have given explicit consent, such as providing optional demographic information. You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to withdrawal.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===== SECTION 5 ===== -->
<h2>5. How We Share Your Information</h2>

<p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to any third party.</strong></p>

<p>We may share limited information with the following categories of service providers, strictly for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> &mdash; A third-party subscription-management platform. RevenueCat receives anonymous device identifiers and transaction data solely to process and manage in-app subscriptions. For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat&rsquo;s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics Providers</strong> &mdash; To collect aggregate, anonymized usage data for app-performance analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Crash-Reporting Tools</strong> &mdash; To receive crash logs and diagnostics for identifying and resolving technical issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>All service providers are bound by contractual obligations to process your data only for the purposes specified, to maintain appropriate security measures, and to comply with applicable data-protection laws.</p>

<p>We may also disclose information where we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request;</li>
  <li>Enforce our terms of service or other agreements;</li>
  <li>Protect the rights, property, or safety of Rater, our users, or the public.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===== SECTION 6 ===== -->
<h2>6. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older. <strong>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</strong></p>

<p>If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we will take prompt steps to delete that information.</p>

<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:raterapphelp@gmail.com">raterapphelp@gmail.com</a> so that we can investigate and take appropriate action.</p>

<p>For users between the ages of 13 and 17, we strongly encourage parental awareness and oversight of App usage.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 7 ===== -->
<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Locally stored data</strong> (photos, scan results, analysis history, and demographic information) resides solely on your device. This data is <strong>not</strong> retained by us on any server and is permanently deleted when you uninstall the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription and purchase records</strong> managed by RevenueCat and Google Play are retained in accordance with those services&rsquo; respective privacy policies and applicable legal retention requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics and diagnostic data</strong> is retained in aggregate, anonymized form and is periodically purged in accordance with our data-management practices.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===== SECTION 8 ===== -->
<h2>8. Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect the personal information we process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All data transmitted to third-party services (such as RevenueCat) is encrypted in transit using industry-standard TLS/SSL protocols.</li>
  <li>Facial analysis data and photos remain on your device and are never transmitted over any network. The security of that data is governed by the security measures of your device and operating system.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we employ commercially reasonable measures to protect your information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is entirely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 9 ===== -->
<h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<h3>9.1 All Users</h3>
<p>Regardless of your location, you may:</p>

  <li>Delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the App.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.2 European Economic Area &amp; United Kingdom Residents (GDPR)</h3>
<p>In addition to the rights above, if you are in the EEA or UK you have the right to:</p>

</ul>

<h3>9.3 California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the CCPA and CPRA:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You may request that we disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources, the business purpose for collection, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You may request the deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain legal exceptions.</li>

<!-- ===== SECTION 10 ===== -->
<h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Certain information processed by third-party service providers (such as RevenueCat) may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States. These countries may have data-protection laws that differ from the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Where such transfers occur, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place&mdash;including standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, where applicable&mdash;to protect your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

<p>Facial analysis data and photos remain on your device and are <strong>not</strong> transferred internationally.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 11 ===== -->
<h2>11. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

<p>Some web browsers transmit &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) signals. Because there is no universally accepted standard for how to respond to DNT signals, the App does not currently respond to DNT signals. We do not track users across third-party websites or services.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 12 ===== -->
<h2>12. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

<p>The App may contain links to third-party websites, services, or content that are not operated or controlled by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access through the App. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or security of any third-party services.</p>

<!-- ===== SECTION 13 ===== -->
<h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make material changes, we will revise the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; at the top of this page and, where required by law, provide additional notice (such as an in-app notification).</p>

<p>Your continued use of the App following the posting of an updated Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
